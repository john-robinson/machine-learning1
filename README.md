In this first project, you will get accustomed with some classical machine learning algorithms and concepts, such as under- and over-fitting. For each algorithm, we ask you to deliver a separate Python script. Make sure that your experiments are reproducible (e.g., by manually fixing random seeds). Add a brief report (pdf format, roughly 4 pages without the figures) giving your observations and conclusions. Each project must be carried out by groups of two to three students and submitted to Gradescope1 before October 23, 23:59 GMT+2. There will be two projects to submit to: one for your Python scripts and one for your report. Note that attention will be paid to how you present your results. Careful thoughts in particular - but not limited to - should be given when it comes to plots.
